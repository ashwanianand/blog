What is love?<br/>
Feelings of your mate,<br/>
with whom you imagine your fate.<br/>
You met earlier two days,<br/>
for whom you changed your ways,<br/>
think you is love,<br/>
but is not the thing you deserve.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your mother,<br/>
who cared for you like a feather.<br/>
The love in her milk,<br/>
is far valuable than silver & silk.<br/>
Her affection is at peak,<br/>
unequaled and unique.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your dad,<br/>
who is there when you are glad or sad.<br/>
He is one of your dear friends,<br/>
with you, till the life ends,<br/>
who taught you to walk,<br/>
to laugh and to talk.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your sister and brother,<br/>
you need not to bother,<br/>
with whom everything you share,<br/>
who take your care.<br/>
Their sacrifice for you, times too many,<br/>
you can't buy with a penny.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your buddies, very dear,<br/>
who take away your sorrows and fear.<br/>
With whom you play and fight,<br/>
laugh and cry and read and write.<br/>
A boy or a girl,<br/>
a friend is precious than a pearl.<br/>
<br/>
What is love?<br/>
Now, you know it very well..
